Sigrand SG16-PCI modem
Linux driver for 2.4.x kernel, version 1.1, date 03.03.2006

1. Introduction

This driver supports Sigrand SG16-PCI modems under Linux operating system
as standard ethernet-like netrwork interface.

2. Installation

To install driver you may use Makefile shipped with driver source code.

 make install

This command will compile and link  driver as well as sg16cfg utility 
used for configuring driver itself(see below). You need to have a Linux 
kernel 2.4.x source code; it supposed that it placed in /usr/src/linux by
default, but you may specify path using KERNELSOURCEPATH variable.

e.g :
 make install KERNELSOURCEPATH=/usr/src/linux-2.4.19

Also you may specify two additional Variables KERNELVERSION - kernel
version, current by default and MODULEPATH - path to place where module
will copy. sg16cfg utility always copies to /sbin directory.


3. Driver Configuration

After you've loaded  module(using insmod command) you may see that few
eth* devices appear in your system( as much as Sigrand SG16-PCI modems you
have). Now you have to  configure them using sg16cfg utility.

 sg16cfg <device> <parameters>

e.g:
 sg16cfg eth1 master lrate=1544 tcpam16 netaddr=0x345

You may add such command within linux init scripts to not run it each time
your system boots up. There is a list of parameters:

 master or slave - mode of modem work(slave by default)
 lrate=<value>  - connection speed (365 by default)
 tcpam16, tcpam32,
 tcpam8          - line coding
 netaddr=<value> - three low digits of MAC address

First nine digits of MAC-address fixed and always 00:ff:01:a3:9, you may
specify three last digits. If you don't specify them system will generate
them randomly at boot time (not recommended). After driver successfully
configuration you should activate network interface using ifconfig command.

NOTE: You shouldn't unload driver's module each time you want to modify
parameters, it is enough to deactivate netowrk interface.

e.g:
 ifconfig eth3 down
 sg16cfg eth3 lrate=730 nogain
 ifconfig eth3 inet 192.168.5.25 netmask 0xffffff00

sg16cfg utility has two additional parameters wich switch off packet
reading/writing mode
on PCI bus(burst mode) : rboff, wboff.

4. Driver statistics


Except statistics shown by netstat and ifconfig you may see low-level
driver's statistics:

 sg16cfg <interface>
e.g.
 sg16cfg eth3

  If you want to reset statistics you should use -R key.

e.g
 sg16cfg eth3 -R
