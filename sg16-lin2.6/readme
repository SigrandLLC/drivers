Linux driver for Sigrand SG-16PCI and  SG-16ISA modems
for Linux kernel v2.6.x.
Version: 2.0
Date:    20.11.2006

1. Introduction

This driver supports Sigrand SG-16PCI, SG-16ISA  modems under Linux operating 
system as standard ethernet-like netrwork interface.

2. Installation

To install driver you need Linux kernel 2.6.x source code, sysfs and driver 
hotplug firmware loading support.

Installation steps
2.1. run `./configure [options]` ( ./configure --help to see list of available options ).
This program will check configuration of specified kernel and generate 
Makefile and configuration utility.

./configure checks /proc/config.gz (if this option was set in the kernel).
If you compile driver not for current kernel, use option --no-proc-cfg 
of configure script. 
If /proc/config.gz is missing, ./configure use <Linux-Kernel-Path>/.config 
file to ensure that necessary options in kernel are switched on, so if 
your .config file does not respond to real configuration of kernel,
simply set those options by `make menuconfig` without any kernel compilation

Support of ISA cards is optional. If you have SG-16ISA card, run ./configure
with `--isa-support` option. For correct driver work you need ISA PnP sybsystem
enabled in kernel, if not - you will get warnings at compile time.
     
2.2. `make install`

After installation you will have:
 - driver sg16lan.ko, installed in 
   /lib/modules/<KERNELVERSION>/kernel/drivers/net  directory
 - configuration utility sg16cfg, installed in /sbin 
 - firmware in firmware dir ( by default - /lib/firmware, can be changed with
   ./configure script )

3. Firmware
There are one firmware available in current distributive:
 - v530e:       max rate: 6016 Kbit/s
                no autorate available
		remote slave configuration ( by master )		

If you want to install different firmware - use 
sg16cfg:
	sg16cfg fwinst <path>

4. Driver Configuration

After you've loaded  module(using insmod command) you may see that few
dsl* devices appear in your system( as much as Sigrand modems you have).

When driver starts by default it will download firmware during loading. You can 
turn this feature off with `./configure --autostart-off` (see installation 
section). Also at installation step you can change default modem settings, 
which will be applied at driver loading.

To change default modem settings:
4.1. `ifconfig dslX down`  ( if it was up )
4.2. use sg16cfg SG-16 configuration utility to change settings
4.3. `ifconfig dslX up` ( for applying changes )

MAC address assign:
First nine digits of MAC-address fixed and always 00:ff:01:a3:9, you may
specify three last digits. If you don't specify them system will generate
them randomly at boot time (not recommended). After successfull driver 
configuration you should activate network interface using ifconfig command.

sg16cfg utility has two additional parameters which turn on/off burst
reading/writing mode on PCI bus(burst mode) : rbon/rboff, wbon/wboff.

Configuration example:
1) Static rate ( 6016 ), TCPAM32, master:
    # ifconfig dslX down
    # sg16cfg dslX rate 6016 tcpam32 master
    # ifconfig dslX up
2) Remote slave configuration ( by master ), rate 5696
    a) Master-end configuration:
    master # ifconfig dslX down
    master # sg16cfg dslX cfg preact rate 5696 annex F master
    master # ifconfig dslX up
    b) Slave-end configuration:
    slave # ifconfig dslX down
    slave # sg16cfg dslX cfg preact annex F slave
    slave # ifconfig dslX up
Note: You MUST set annex to F for remote configuration up to 5696 kbps
      
5. Driver statistics

Besides the statistics shown by netstat and ifconfig you may see low-level
driver's statistics. Execute `sg16cfg --help` for more information.
